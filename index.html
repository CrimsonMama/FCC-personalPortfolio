            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="myBlurb">Creativity has been in my family for many generations. When I was younger I 
                enjoyed drawing and painting and had an interest in comic book art. I recieved A-Levels in both 
                Art and Psychology but never really had a strong idea of what I wanted to do as a career. I went 
                to college and got a diploma in Art but my passion was more for my personal interests than what I 
                could do on a career level. I also realised too late that Graphic Design would have been a better 
                choice more suited to the type of art I enjoyed.<br>
                After many years spent working and travelling and concentrating on family life I found myself in a
                dark place. But I learned from my mistakes and found myself with the time and maturity to know what 
                I wanted from my life! For the first time in 20 years I could pursue a career and found a love for computer
                programming, web design and web development!<br>
                Computers are definitely the future! And allows me to combine my creative talents with the technological
                skills of the world today! And the scope of fields available to work in is vast! I love the knowledge 
                that in this field I will always have more to learn and different areas to explore! 
            </p>

            <h1>My GitHub Account</h1>
            <p class="myBlurb">No computer coder would be complete without learning how to use GitHub and producing some
                works on the site. GitHub is a wonderful resource which allows collaboration on projects and of course
                that all important ability to publish your work live to the web.<br>
                Below is the link to my GitHub and projects.
